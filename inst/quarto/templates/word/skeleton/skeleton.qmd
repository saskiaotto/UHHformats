# Introduction

## YAML header

Configure the YAML header including the following elements:

- *title*: Title
- *subtitle*: Subtitle; remove option completely if you don't need a subtitle.
- *author*: Character of single or multiple author(s)
- *date*: A date
- *abstract*: The abstract will be shown right after the title in smaller font size. 
- *lang*: The language of the document. Default is English ('en'). For German use 'de'.
- *bibliography*: A path to the bibliography file to use for references (BibTeX *.bib* file). The current file includes 3 dummy references; either insert your references into this file or replace the file with your own.
- *csl*: The style is provided in the 'sage-harvard.csl' file, which adopts the [SAGE Harvard](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/sage_harvard_reference_style_0.pdf) reference style. Just leave the file as it is.
- *format - docx*: In this template many of the Quarto options for Word output are listed in the YAML header. If you want to know more about these settings I recommend the [MS Word format reference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/docx.html) for a complete list of available options. For instance, you can adjust the figure and table references with *fig-title*, *tbl-title*, *fig-prefix*, and *tbl-prefix*.
- *execute*: Global options for customizing output from executed code are specified within this execute key.

This Quarto template uses a 'uhh-template.docx' Word file, which is based on the [standard template file](https://www.kus.uni-hamburg.de/themen/oeffentlichkeitsarbeit/corporate-design/vorlagen.html) of the University of Hamburg (UHH) except for the font type, which is by default 'Helvetica'.  If you are associated with the UHH you are allowed to use the University's own font style 'TheSansUHH'. You can choose between both fonts when running the function, e.g., `UHHformats::create_quarto_doc(dirname = "your_word_doc", template = "word", font = "TheSansUHH")`.

If you feel like using your own template or the standard Word template (i.e. the Normal.dot file), simply provide the path to your file or comment/delete this line, respectively. 


## Code blocks

Code blocks in Quarto documents are treated in similar way as in Markdown documents. One important difference is that code chunk options (in Quarto also called 'cell level options') are typically included in special comments using `#|` at the top of code chunks rather than within the line that begins the chunk:

```{r}
#| eval: false
summary(cars)
```

Please note that individual words are separated with a hyphen, not a dot, followed by a colon, not an equal sign as in R Markdown documents. Quarto uses this approach to both better accommodate longer options like `fig-cap`, `fig-subcap`, and `fig-alt` as well as to make it straightforward to edit chunk options within more structured editors that don’t have an easy way to edit chunk metadata (e.g. most traditional notebook UIs).

However, if you prefer it is still possible to include chunk options on the first line (e.g. ```{r, echo = FALSE}) as in R Markdown documents. 


## Callout blocks

Quarto provides five different types of callouts that are an excellent way to draw extra attention to certain concepts. 

::: callout-note
The color and icon will be different depending upon the type that you select. You can choose between: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.

# Methods

## Cross-referencing

External images and R figures can be referenced with `@fig-label`, where 'label' is the name of the code chunk. These label names should not contain underscores to separate words, use hyphens here instead. Note that figures need to have a caption to be numbered and for cross-referencing, The caption is also set in the chunk option with `#| fig-cap: "Your caption"`.

Tables require similarly a label and table caption for cross-referencing. But here, the cross-reference contains the prefix 'tbl': `@tbl-label`. 

Cross-references to individual sections can simply be made with the prefix 'sec' and by adding a '{#sec-identifier}' to any heading.

This is for example a cross-reference to @tbl-kable in @sec-tables and a cross-reference to @fig-base in @sec-figures.

To create a reference-able code block, add a #lst-identifier along with a lst-cap attribute inside the curly braces (see code chunk example @lst-codeblock). Note that the indication of the programming language requires for this static code block a dot set before the 'r'.

``` {.r #lst-codeblock lst-cap="Example for a referenceable code block"}
4+4
```


## Mathematical equations

Use mathematics as usual with the dollar sign `$` at the beginning and end of the equation; either in **inline mode** with one dollar sign such as $E = mc^2$ or in **display mode** with two dollar signs: $$E = mc^2$$

Important to note: do not leave a space between the '\$' and your mathematical notation.

Alternatively, you can use LaTeX for more control and when equations are more complicated. LaTeX equations are also automatically numbered if you define a label within the equation environment, which is useful if you have many equations and want to cross-reference them. The equation label needs to be written with '#eq:label' before the end of the equation (see @eq-mean):

$$
  \bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}
$$ {#eq-mean}

Formulas and corresponding explanations should be integrated into the sentence and, thus, end with a comma or period. Here comes an example:

If the random variable $Y$ follows a standard normal distribution, i.e. $Y \sim N(0,1)$, it's density function can be described with

$$
f_{Y}(y)=\varphi(y) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left\{ -\frac{y^2}{2} \right\}, \quad y \in \mathbb{R}.
$$ {#eq-density-norm}

$\pi$ represents the circle number or Ludolph's number. The function

$$
  F_{Y}(y)=\Phi(y) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \int_{-\infty}^y \varphi(x) \,\mathrm{d}x, \quad y \in \mathbb{R}
$$ {#eq-dist-func}


represents then the distribution function of @eq-density-norm.

The numbering of equations, as in @eq-density-norm, should only be done if they are referred to in the rest of the text. Especially if there are many equations in the thesis, the use of LaTeX seems to make more sense.


## Images

Quarto includes several features aimed at making it easier to work with figures and subfigures, as well as for laying out panels that contain multiple figures, tables, or other content.

[![Single image of Iris setosa with URL link but no cross-reference.](images/wikipedia_iris_setosa.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_setosa){fig-align="left" fig-alt="Wikipedia image of Iris setosa."}

For instance, if you have several figures that appear as a group, you can create a figure div to enclose them (see @fig-versicolor and @fig-virginica).

::: {layout-ncol=2 layout-valign="bottom"}

![Iris versicolor](images/wikipedia_iris_versicolor.jpg){#fig-versicolor}

![Iris virginica](images/wikipedia_iris_virginica.jpg){#fig-virginica}

:::

The layout attribute enables the creation of much more complex layouts. @fig-custom-layout provides an example with a common figure caption and one identifier for all three.

::: {#fig-custom-layout layout="[20,-2,46,-2,30]" layout-valign="bottom"}

![Iris setosa](images/wikipedia_iris_setosa.jpg)

![Iris versicolor](images/wikipedia_iris_versicolor.jpg)

![Iris virginica](images/wikipedia_iris_virginica.jpg)

# Results

## R output

R output is typically shown in the monospace font (here an example with the `mtcars` dataset in the subfolder `data/`): 

```{r}
# Import dataset from the data/ folder
mtcars <- read.csv("data/mtcars.csv")
summary(mtcars[,1:4])
```


## Tables {#sec-tables}

If the output format is Word tables are generated best using R packages instead of R Markdown syntax. The following two sections demonstrate some useful packages.

### Using the *knitr* package

@tbl-kable is an example of using *knitr::kable()* to generate the table. 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-kable
#| tbl-cap: "This is a table produced with knitr::kable()."
# Plot only a subset of the data
df <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
knitr::kable(
  df, 
  longtable = TRUE,
  booktabs = TRUE
) 
# (the last two options make the table a bit more readable)
```


### The *huxtable* package

If you are interested in further table adaptations for Word output, I highly recommend a look at the R package ['huxtable'](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/index.html). The following code will produce an example table if the *huxtable* package is installed:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-huxtable
#| eval: !expr ifelse(nzchar(system.file(package = "huxtable")), "true", "false")
library(huxtable)
df <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
ht <- as_hux(df, add_rownames = "model")
ht <- set_outer_borders(ht, 0.4)
bold(ht)[1,]           <- TRUE
bottom_border(ht)[1,]  <- 0.4
align(ht)[,2:7]          <- 'right'
align(ht)[,1]          <- 'left'
number_format(ht)      <- 2
width(ht)              <- 1
font_size(ht) <- 10
caption(ht)            <- "Overview of the first lines and columns in the mtcars dataset."

ht
```


## Figures {#sec-figures}

A base graphics scatterplot (@fig-base).

```{r}
#| label: fig-base
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between horsepower and fuel economy."
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg,
xlab = "Gross Horsepower",
ylab = "Miles Per Gallon",
pch = 19)
abline(lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars), col = "red")
```

Here for comparison a boxplot with a different image height (@fig-boxplot).

```{r}
#| label: fig-boxplot
#| fig-cap: "Fuel differences between transmission types (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)."
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 3
boxplot(mpg ~ am, mtcars)
```


## Diagrams

Quarto has native support for embedding *Mermaid* and *Graphviz* diagrams. This enables you to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, gnatt charts, and more using a plain text syntax inspired by markdown.

### Mermaid

Mermaid is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams (see @fig-mermaid-diagram).

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-mermaid-diagram
%%| fig-cap: Simple flowchart based on the JS-tool Mermaid.
%%| fig-width: 6
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
  style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
  style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

::: callout-note
Cell level options are here indicated with `%%|` instead of `#|`!
:::

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-mermaid-diagram
%%| fig-cap: A sequence diagram based on Mermaid.
%%| fig-width: 6

sequenceDiagram
  participant Alice
  participant Bob
  Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
  loop Healthcheck
    John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
  end
  Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
  John-->>Alice: Great!
  John->>Bob: How about you?
  Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```

### Graphviz

The [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language and make diagrams in useful formats. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes (see @fig-dot-diagram).

```{dot}
//| label: fig-dot-diagram
//| fig-cap: "An example for a diagram made with Graphviz."

graph G {
  layout=neato
  run -- intr;
  intr -- runbl;
  runbl -- run;
  run -- kernel;
  kernel -- zombie;
  kernel -- sleep;
  kernel -- runmem;
  sleep -- swap;
  swap -- runswap;
  runswap -- new;
  runswap -- runmem;
  new -- runmem;
  sleep -- runmem;
}
```

Cell level options are here indicated with `//|`!

# Adding citations and bibliography

Link a `.bib` document via the YAML header, and the bibliography will be printed at the end. The default bibliography style is provided in the `sage-harvard.csl` file (do not delete), which adopts the [SAGE Harvard](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/sage_harvard_reference_style_0.pdf) reference style.

References can be cited directly within the document using the Quarto equivalent of the \LaTeX citation system `[@key]`, where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry in the .csl file. Example: [@Taylor1937]. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons (e.g., [@Knupp1999; @Kamm2000]. You can also write in-text citations, as follows: @Taylor1937 say this and that.

There is also the package [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr) which I highly recommend: *citr* provides functions and an RStudio add-in to search a BibTeX-file to create and insert formatted Markdown citations into the current document. If you are using the reference manager [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) the add-in can access your reference database directly.

## Software

If you want to include a paragraph on the software used, here is some example text/code to get the current R and package versions. The code to create a separate bibliography file named 'packages.bib' with all package references has already been added at the beginning of this script (code chunk 'generate-package-refs').

All analyses were performed using the statistical software R (version `r paste(R.Version()$major, R.Version()$minor, sep = ".")`) [@R-base]. This thesis, including tables, was generated using the R packages 'rmarkdown' (version `r packageVersion("rmarkdown")`) [@R-rmarkdown], and 'knitr' (version `r packageVersion("knitr")`) [@R-knitr]. 


## Examples for footnotes

Here is a footnote reference[^1], and another[^2].

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^2]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

<!-- This will start a new page (LaTeX code) -->

\newpage

<!-- Pandoc will automatically generate a list of works cited and place it in the document if the style calls for it. It will be placed in a div with the id refs if one exists: -->
