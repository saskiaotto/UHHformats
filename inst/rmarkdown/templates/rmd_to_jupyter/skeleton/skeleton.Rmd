## Short introduction

This is a short demo on how to convert an R Markdown file into a Jupyter Notebook using 
this template.

`UHHformats::rmd_to_jupyter` is a custom knit function that converts your R Markdown file into
a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (formerly known as IPython Notebook, hence, the file extension
`.ipynb`). Jupyter Notebook files are simple JSON documents, that contain text, source code,
rich media output, and metadata where each segment of the document is stored in a cell. This
function converts the R Markdown code directly into a prettified JSON string using 
`jsonlite::toJSON` and `jsonlite::prettify` and saves it in an `.ipynb` file once you click 
the *knit* button.

To run this function you don't have to have more than the R package `jsonlite` installed.


#### Data

We will use the ubiquitous [iris](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/iris.html) dataset.

```{r}
head(iris)
```

### Graphics

#### Base graphics 

Let's create a simple scatterplot of `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width`.

```{r}
plot(iris$Sepal.L ~ iris$Sepal.Width,
    ylab = 'Sepal length',
    xlab = 'Sepal width')
```


#### ggplot2 graphics

To run the following line of code make sure that you have `ggplot2` installed in Jupyter Notebook, using the `install.packages` function.
Once it is installed, you can get started by loading it into your workspace as you would do in R or R Studio:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Here comes the same plot now made with ggplot2:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) +
 geom_point()
```
