# The Article Header Information

Configure the YAML header including the following elements:

* `title`: Title
* `author`: Character of single or multiple author(s)
* `date`: The date; by default `\date`, will populate the date automatically.
* `fontsize`: Font size for body text; choose between `10pt`, `11pt` (default), and `12pt`.
* `german`: If option is set to `true`, the table and figure caption, the page information, as well as the ToC and reference header will be in German; default is `false` (i.e., English).
* `linkcolor`, `filecolor`, `citecolor`, `urlcolor`: Specify here colors for internal links (incl. ToC), external links, citation links, and linked URLs, respectively, if you don't want the default colors; use options allowed by xcolor, including the dvipsnames, svgnames, and x11names lists.
* `classoption`: Further options for the document class `article` (used for this report); specify here whether report should be 'onesided' (default) or 'twosided'.
* `bibliography`: A path to the bibliography file(s) to use for references (BibTeX *.bib* file). This template uses the bibliography-related package [natbib](https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib). The current file 'references.bib' in the 'bib/' folder includes 3 dummy references; either insert your references into this file or replace the file with your own.
* `bibliographystyle`: The style is provided in the bibstyle.bst file, which adopts the [SAGE Harvard](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/sage_harvard_reference_style_0.pdf) reference style. Just leave the file as it is.
* `params`: The cover and logo image directories for the front page are specified here.
* `header_includes`: Here you can add additional \LaTeX code to include in the header, before the `\\begin\{document\}` statement. 
* If you want to add additional LaTeX code to include before the `\\end\{document\}` statement use the field `include_after`. 
* `output`: The nested fields for the output field are based on the arguments of the output function. Since `UHHformats::pdf_report` is based on `rmarkdown::pdf_document`, see its help page for more options. Current default settings are
    * `toc = TRUE`
    * `toc_depth = 5`
    * `number_sections = TRUE`
    * `highlight = "kate"`
    * `font = "Helvetica"`
    * `citation_package = "natbib"`
    * `latex_engine = "xelatex"`
    
If you are associated with the UHH you can also use the University's own font "TheSansUHH". In that case replace `font = "Helvetica"` with `font = "TheSansUHH"`. To use another font, simply use the setting "other" and replace the 'font_XXX.ttf' files in the working directory with your own files. Please note, that you have to name these files exactly as the template font files.


# The Body of the Article

## R Markdown syntax vs \LaTeX syntax

As with any .Rmd file you can write the entire report in the R Markdown syntax. However, if you are familiar with \LaTeX you can also mix both:

### R Markdown subsection

This is a dummy text to show you how to write in **bold** and in *italics*.

\subsubsection{LaTeX subsection}

This is a dummy text to show you that you can also write in \textbf{bold} and in \textit{italics} with \LaTeX.


## Cross-referencing within the report

To cross-references figures or tables you have to have a:

* **caption to your figure (or table)**: 
    * NOTE: figures without a caption will be included directly as images and will therefore not be a numbered figure
* **labeled code chunk**: this provides the identifier for referencing the figure or table generated by the chunk.

Cross-references within the text can then be made using the standard \LaTeX syntax `\@ref{type:label}`, where label is the chunk label and type is the environment being referenced (e.g. tab, fig, or eq). Examples are given in the sections below (e.g. in 
[R Markdown table]).

To cross-reference sections simply put the section header in square brackets, e.g. [R output] via `[R output]`.


## Mathematics

Use mathematics in R Markdown as usual using the dollar sign `$`; either in inline mode with one dollar sign, e.g. $E = mc^2$, or in display mode with two:

$$E = mc^2$$
Important to note: do not leave a space between the `$` and your mathematical notation.

Alternatively, you can use \LaTeX for more control, e.g. for setting equation numbers that can be cross-referenced: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mean}
  \bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n} 
\end{equation}

You may refer to this equation using `\ref{eq:label}`, e.g., see Equation \ref{eq:mean}

## R output

R output is typically shown in the monospace font (here an example with the `mtcars` dataset in the subfolder `data/`): 
```{r}
# Import dataset from the data/folder
mtcars <- read.csv("data/mtcars.csv")
summary(mtcars[,1:4])
```


## Tables

### R Markdown table

Table \ref{tab:rmd_tab} is a R Markdown table including a caption (note: the table number is automatically assigned) and label for cross-referencing: 

| A            | New              | Table          |
|:-------------|:----------------:|---------------:|
|left-aligned  |center-aligned    |right-aligned   |
|$123          |$456              |$789            |
|*italics*     |~~strikethrough~~ |**boldface**    |

Table: Your Caption \label{tab:rmd_tab}

### Tables generated with R


#### Using the *knitr* and  *kableExtra* packages

&nbsp; <!-- This creates vertical space and is the same than \vspace{12pt} for latex -->

Table \ref{tab:kable_tab} is an example when using `knitr::kable()` to generate the table and *kableExtra* functions to modify it:

```{r}
df <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
kable(df, "latex", 
  booktabs = TRUE, 
  caption = "A table produced with knitr and kableextra",
  label = "kable_tab") %>%
kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 9,
latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Group 1" = 2, "Group 2" = 2,
"Group 3" = 1, "Group 4" = 1)) %>%
add_header_above(c(" ", "Group 5" = 4, "Group 6" = 2), bold = T) %>%
footnote(general = "Your comments go here.")
```

#### The *xtable* package

Another useful package for tables for PDF output is [xtable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf). The following code will produce an example table if the *xtable* package is installed. Note that you need to add the chunk option `results = "asis"` inside `{r}` otherwise the PDF will contain the \LaTeX code of the table!

```{r, results = "asis", eval=ifelse(nzchar(system.file(package = "xtable")), TRUE, FALSE)}
xt <- xtable(df, caption = "A table made with xtable", 
  label = "tab:xtable_tab")
print(xt, comment = FALSE, caption.placement = "top", booktabs = TRUE)
```

You can also use \LaTeX in the R code chunk:

```{r, results = "asis", eval=ifelse(nzchar(system.file(package = "xtable")), TRUE, FALSE)}
tab <- xtable(head(iris, n = 20), align = "|C|C|C|C|C|C|")

addtorow <- list()
addtorow$pos <- list()
addtorow$pos[[1]] <- -1
addtorow$command <- c("\\rowcolor{lightgray}")

print(tab,
      include.rownames = FALSE,
      tabular.environment = "tabularx",
      width = "\\textwidth",
      comment = FALSE,
      add.to.row = addtorow)
```


## Figures

```{r fig.cap = "Relationship between horsepower and fuel economy\\label{fig:base-ref}", out.width='100%'}
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg,
xlab = "Gross Horsepower",
ylab = "Miles Per Gallon",
pch = 19)
abline(lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars), col = "red")
```

Figures are supported from R code and can be referenced (see Figure \ref{fig:base-ref}) by including the `\\label{}` tag in the `fig.cap` attribute of the R chunk: `fig.cap = "Relationship between horsepower and fuel economy\\label{fig:base-ref}"`. It is a quirky hack at the moment, see [here](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/323).

Figure \ref{fig:boxplot-ref} shows a boxplot with just half the width and centered: 

```{r, fig.cap = "Fuel differences between transmission types (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)\\label{fig:boxplot-ref}", out.width='50%', fig.height = 6, fig.align='center'}
boxplot(mpg ~ am, mtcars)
```



# Adding citations and bibliography

Link a `.bib` document via the YAML header and the bibliography will be printed at the very end (as usual). The default bibliography style is provided in the `bib.bst` file (do not delete), which adopts the [SAGE Harvard](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/sage_harvard_reference_style_0.pdf) reference style.

References can be cited directly within the document using the R Markdown equivalent of the \LaTeX citation system `[@key]`, where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry in the .bib file. Example: [@Taylor1937]. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons, e.g. [@Knupp1999; @Kamm2000].

There is also the package [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr), which I highly recommend: *citr* provides functions and an RStudio add-in to search a BibTeX-file to create and insert formatted Markdown citations into the current document. If you are using the reference manager [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) the add-in can access your reference database directly. 


## Software

If you want to include a paragraph on the software used, here is some example text/code to get the current R and package versions. The code to create a separate bibiliography file named 'packages.bib' with all package references has already been added at the beginning of this script (code chunk 'generate-package-refs').

All analyses were performed using the statistical software R (version `r paste(R.Version()$major, R.Version()$minor, sep = ".")`) [@R-base]. This report, including tables and figures, was generated using the packages 'rmarkdown' (version `r packageVersion("rmarkdown")`) [@R-rmarkdown], 'bookdown' (version `r packageVersion("bookdown")`) [@R-bookdown], 'UHHformats' (version `r packageVersion("UHHformats")`) [@R-UHHformats], 'knitr' (version `r packageVersion("knitr")`) [@R-knitr], 'kableExtra' (version `r packageVersion("kableExtra")`) [@R-kableExtra], 'xtable' (version `r packageVersion("xtable")`) [@R-xtable], and 'tidyverse' (version `r packageVersion("tidyverse")`) [@R-tidyverse.]
