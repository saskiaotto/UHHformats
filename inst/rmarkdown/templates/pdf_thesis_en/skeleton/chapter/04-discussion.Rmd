# Discussion

Providing strict guidelines and rules for a good discussion is difficult. But the following recommendations might be helpful:

- The discussion follows the opposite structure than the introduction and should move from the specific to the more general topics.
- Summary/recapitulation: You should start the discussion with a short summary of your main results and whether they support your hypothesis/hypotheses or not. Avoid here any statistical language as in the result section. You should again sketch out your line of argumentation in this section.
- Continue with the main messages of your empirical or theoretical study or your literature review: What are new insights from your results?
- Discussion of individual findings: expose results concisely and evaluate them critically. Potential questions that could be addressed here:
    - Are the findings convincing?
    - In empirical studies: which conclusions about the problem studied can be drawn? What are the implications of your findings? Which theories and previous studies support your results, which are contradicting?
    - In literature reviews: how many of the publications included in your analyses were high-quality and most recent? How many were outdated or had methodological flaws? Is there consensus across studies? Or are there group of studies that found different results?
    - Which questions remain still unanswered? Which come out as important due to your findings?
- Point out the limitations of your study (assist reader in judging validity of findings). Are there any results that contradict your hypothesis and how can they be explained? Discuss to which extent your results can be generalized.

## Conclusion

- Which *take home messages* do you like to give the reader? What is the relevance of your study for future research and potential applications? Suggest issues for future research.
- One *final sentence* the complete the thesis.
