# Material and Methods

The structure of this chapter depends very much on the type of research study, whether it is a field, laboratory or modelling study or a literature review. For field studies, the typical subsections are the

- study site
- experimental set-up
- sampling design
- statistical analysis with information on the used computer program ^[such as [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) - this is an example of a footnote]

## Study site

If you want to add external images here, e.g. to show the sampling site as in Fig. \@ref(fig:location), use the `knitr::include_graphics()` function:

```{r location, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Location of sampling site....", out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling_site.jpg")
```


## Cross-references

External images and R figures can be referenced with `\@ref(fig:<label>)`, where `<label>` is the name of the code chunk (in the above example its *location*). These label names should **not contain underscores** to separate words, use hyphens here instead. Note that figures need to have a caption to be numbered and for cross-referencing, The caption is also set in the chunk option with `fig.cap='Your caption'`.

Cross-references to individual sections can simply be made by placing the name of the section into squared brackets, e.g. a link to the [Discussion] is made via `[Discussion]`.

Tables require also a label and table caption for cross-referencing as figures. But here, the cross-reference contains a `tab:` in `\@ref(tab:<name>)`) instead of a `fig:`. Also, captions of tables produced with R cannot be set in the chunk options as for figures but in the R functions directly (see examples in the [Results]).

This is for example a cross-reference to table \@ref(tab:kable1) in the [Using the `knitr` and  `kableExtra` packages] chapter.

**Important note**: Labels for tables produced with R Markdown syntax have to be set with \LaTeX notation, hence, the cross-reference has to be also in \LaTeX (see for an example [R Markdown table]).


## Formulas

Use mathematics in R Markdown as usual using the dollar sign `$`; either in **inline mode** with one dollar sign $E = mc^2$ or in **display mode** with two `$$`: $$E = mc^2$$
Important to note: do not leave a space between the `$` and your mathematical notation.

Alternatively, you can use \LaTeX for more control and when equations are more complicated. \LaTeX equations are also automatically numbered, which is useful if you have many equations and want to cross-reference them (note: if you set a star after the `{equation*}`, as in the last equation, the number is suppressed). The equation label needs to be written in \LaTeX with `\label{eq:label}`, which follows the `\begin{equation}` element (see eq. \@ref(eq:mean)):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mean}
  \bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n} 
\end{equation}  

Formulas and corresponding explanations should be integrated into the sentence and, thus, end with a comma or period. Here comes an example:

If the random variable $Y$ follows a standard normal distribution, i.e. $Y \sim N(0,1)$, it's density function can be described with
\begin{equation} \label{eq:density-norm}
  f_{Y}(y)=\varphi(y) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left\{ -\frac{y^2}{2} \right\}, y \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation}
$\pi$ represents the circle number or Ludolph's number. The function
\begin{equation*}
  F_{Y}(y) = \Phi(y) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \int_{-\infty}^y \varphi(x) \,\mathrm{d}x, \quad y \in \mathbb{R},
\end{equation*}
represents then the distribution function of \@ref(eq:density-norm).
