This R package provides ready-to-use R Markdown and **now also Quarto templates** for HTML, PDF and Microsoft Word output formats, which are used within the Biology Department of the University of Hamburg (UHH) and its *Data Science in Biology* program. The package aims to encourage reproducible research using simple Markdown syntax while embedding all of the R code to produce plots and analyses as well. Included in the package are templates for 

- student assignments, 
- project HTML files, 
- PDF reports,
- cheat sheets, 
- Word documents, and
- conversions to Jupyter Notebook documents.

The default font for all templates is 'Helvetica' but the font can be replaced with the University's own font style 'TheSans UHH' in the PDF and Word templates. If you are associated to the UHH you are allowed to use this font. Most templates include further the UHH logo and have adopted the UHH corporate design, but the logo can easily be replaced in the YAML header and also the style can be modified, by e.g. adding your own CSS stylesheet in the YAML header of the HTML template. Hence, these templates are not limited to UHH students and employees. 

Many templates were developed based on other inspiring templates and R packages, which are mentioned below. **To help getting started, all templates contain already some example text and code** for formatting text, writing equations, creating tables and figures with cross-references and including references.


## Getting started

### R Markdown documents

#### Creating a new document and rendering it within R Studio

Once you installed the package you might need to close and re-open R Studio to see the `UHHformats` 
templates listed.

1. Choose **File** > **New File** > **R Markdown**, then select **From Template**.
You should then be able to create a new document from one of the package templates:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="demo create document", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_create_document.png")
```

2. Choose the directory in which you want to save your file and provide a file name (that name will be used for both the .Rmd file and the new folder in which the .Rmd file will be placed). 

3. If you are interested in the documentation already provided in the template file for getting started, render the document once before you start changing the content (click the `Knit` button).


#### Without R Studio

You can create a new directory inside your current directory, including the ready-to-use R Markdown file and all associated files (e.g. images, fonts, LaTeX templates, etc.), with the built-in function `create_rmd_doc()`, which is adopted from the [rmdformats](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) package.

Use, for instance,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
UHHformats::create_rmd_doc(dirname = "new_doc", template = "pdf_report")
```
to generate a report-like PDF output.

Alternatively, use 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("new_doc.Rmd", template = "html_simple", package = "UHHformats")
```

These functions will automatically create the subdirectory and place the generated .Rmd file and all associated files and folders into it.

You can render your document into the HTML, PDF or Word output format using the `render()` function from the `rmarkdown` package :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("./new-doc")
rmarkdown::render("new-doc.Rmd")
```

**Important note**: `rmarkdown::render` uses as default Pandoc to convert the Markdown document into HTML or PDF. While R Studio uses its internal Pandoc installation (e.g., on a Mac located in '/Applications/R Studio.app/Contents/MacOS/pandoc/'), you need to have Pandoc and its citation parser also installed on your system. See https://pandoc.org/installing.html for instructions. This book chapter is also helpful: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-pandoc.html


### Quarto documents 

Quarto templates are currently not supported in RStudios IDE. Until that changes, you can access these templates with the `create_quarto_doc()` function. The function has three arguments: `dirname` for the name of the subdirectory (and .qmd file), `template` for the output types (choose from 'html', 'pdf_simple', 'pdf_report' or 'word') and `font` for the font type. If the output format is PDF or Word you can choose between the 'Helvetica' and 'TheSansUHH' font. The function will copy the .qmd files and associated files and folders into this new subdirectory

Use, for instance,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
UHHformats::create_qmd_doc(dirname = "my_html_doc", template = "html")
UHHformats::create_qmd_doc(dirname = "my_pdf_doc", template = "pdf_simple", font = "TheSansUHH")
```

to generate a HTML page with the browsers default font or a simple PDF document with the University's own font.

If you are using RStudio, go in the files manager to your new subdirectory, open the .qmd file and click on the **Render** button. For HTML output, you can use alternatively the  `quarto_render()` function from the *quarto* package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("./my_html_doc")
quarto::quarto_render("my_html_doc.qmd",  output_format = "html")
```


### Further requirements - LaTeX

In addition to Pandoc or R Studio being installed, you need to have [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) installed if you want to use the templates that convert R Markdown to PDF output formats. Depending on your operating systems there are different distributions you can use, e.g. for Mac there is [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/), which includes [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/), a nice Mac-only editor for .tex documents. For other OS see here: https://www.latex-project.org/get/

An easy way to install LaTeX on any platform is with the [tinytex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) R package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
# After restarting R Studio, confirm that you have LaTeX with 
tinytex:::is_tinytex() 
```

TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is small in size but that includes most relevant functions (for R users). You may, however, still need to install a few extra LaTeX packages on your first attempt to knit when you use this package.

Although LaTeX is a powerful and popular tool in Academia, it can take a while to learn the syntax and to find the correct formatting. R Markdown and the PDF template in this packages offer a much simpler syntax and the direct embedding of figures and tables, but at the cost of loosing some of the expressiveness of LaTeX. However, you can insert LaTeX code directly into the R Markdown files and also add LaTeX packages and format styles in the YAML header.

If you want to know more about LaTeX, a good start is the *overleaf* tutorial (and its entire documentation):

## R Markdown template gallery

### R Markdown: HTML document (simple design) - `html_simple`

This template converts the R Markdown file into a simple HTML file with a fixed table of content in the upper right corner and a code folding button similar to R notebooks, which is useful in student assignments.

Its function calls internally `rmarkdown::html_document` or `bookdown::html_document2`. The latter is the default, hence, numbered section (set to `FALSE` as default) and automatic numbering of figures and tables is supported. However, please note that the hyperlink in the cross-reference does not yet work in this template. The basis for this function and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is the `html_clean` template developed by Julien Barnier in the [rmdformats](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) package.

The current R Markdown template has in the YAML header:

```
---
title: "Title"
author: "Name"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  UHHformats::html_simple:
    highlight: kate
    code_folding: show
    use_bookdown: true
    number_sections: false
editor_options: 
  chunk_output_type: console
---
```

To get an overview of options that can be set in the YAML header besides `highlight`, `code_folding`, and `number_sections` see the help file for `html_simple` as well `bookdown::html_document2` or `rmarkdown::html_document`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="RMarkdown demo html_simple template", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_rmd_html_simple.png")
```


### R Markdown: HTML document (with bootstrap design 'Material') - `html_material`

This template converts the R Markdown file into an HTML output file that has a navigation bar on the left and in which the different sections (defined by setting header level 1 (#)) are displayed on individual pages or cards. If you want all sections on a single page, add the `cards: false` option in the YAML header. The design is an adaptation from the Material design theme for Bootstrap 3 project: https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design. Also in this template, the HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and R code were originally developed by Julien Barnier in the [rmdformats](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) package and only slightly modified here to tailor it to the *Data Science in Biology* program at the UHH.

Similar to `html_simple`, the underlying function calls internally `rmarkdown::html_document` or (default) `bookdown::html_document2`. But here, the numbered section is set to `TRUE` as default and also the hyperlink in the cross-references works. To get an overview of options that can be set in the YAML header besides `highlight` and `code_folding`, which are shown as examples in the R Markdown template, see the help file for `html_material` as well `bookdown::html_document2` or `rmarkdown::html_document`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="RMarkdown demo html_material template", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_rmd_html_material.png")
```


#### Addtional features available in these HTML templates:

Some extra features were adopted from the [rmdformats](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) 
package, i.e. 

- tabsets are supported like in the default template made with `rmarkdown::html_document()`
- both templates provide automatic thumbnails for figures with lightbox display



### R Markdown: Simple Microsoft Word document - `word_doc`

This template converts the R Markdown file into a Microsoft Word document, which is suitable for student assignments or project reports. The underlying function `word_doc` is a wrapper of `bookdown::word_document2`. By using internally *bookdown* the language settings for figure legends and table captions can be automatically changed from English to German (or any other language).

In the YAML header of the R Markdown template, you can easily customize the language, font, the bibliography style or whether to include a table of content and the title of it. By default `word_doc` uses a 'uhh-template' template file, which is based on the [standard template file](https://www.kus.uni-hamburg.de/themen/oeffentlichkeitsarbeit/corporate-design/vorlagen.html) of the University of Hamburg (UHH) except for the font type, which is set to 'Helvetica'. If you are associated to the UHH you can also use the University's own font "TheSansUHH". In that case replace *font = "Helvetica"* with *font = "TheSansUHH"*. 

If you feel like using your own template or the standard Word template (i.e. the Normal.dot file) simply provide the path to your file or write "default" for the latter case (*reference_docx: "default"*). You can also use another font by using the setting *font = "other"* and replacing the 'font_XXX.ttf' files in the working directory with your own files. Please note, that you have to name these files exactly as the template font files.

If you set the language to German, a configuration file named '_bookdown.yml' is copied into the working directory, which defines the labels of the figure legend and table captions. If you want to use other labels (e.g. 'Abb.' instead of 'Abbildung') feel free to modify the file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="RMarkdown demo word_doc template", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_rmd_word_doc.png")
```



### R Markdown: Simple PDF document in English (default) or German - `pdf_simple`

This template converts the R Markdown file into a simple PDF/LaTeX - based document structured as an article, which is suitable for student assignments. The underlying function `pdf_simple` is a wrapper of `rmarkdown::pdf_document`. Similar to the `pdf_report` template, the YAML header offers various options to adjust the layout of the document.

In the YAML header of the R Markdown template, you can easily customize the logos and cover image, the language, the bibliography style or even add your own LaTeX style with the `include-after` option:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="RMarkdown demo pdf_simple template", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_rmd_pdf_simple.png")
```



### R Markdown: UHH report in in English (default) or German - `pdf_report`

This template converts the R Markdown file into a PDF/LaTeX - based report suitable for project reports and student assignments. The underlying function `pdf_report` is a wrapper of `rmarkdown::pdf_document` and based on the [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package that
provides templates for various journal articles. The Pandoc LaTeX template and the report layout are inspired by INWTlab's [ireports](https://github.com/INWTlab/ireports) package.

In the YAML header of the R Markdown template, you can easily customize the logos and cover image, the language, the bibliography style or even add your own LaTeX style with the `include-after` option:

```
---
title: "Document title"
author: "Author name(s)"
date: \today
fontsize: 11pt
german: false
bibliography: bibfile.bib       
bibliographystyle: bibstyle.bst
params:
  cover: images/cover.png
  title_logo_left: images/uhh_logo.png
  title_logo_right: images/min_logo.png
  logo_small: images/logo_icon.png
output:
  UHHformats::pdf_report:
    df_print: kable
---
```

For more details on available arguments in `pdf_report` (in addition to `df_print` as shown here) see its help file as well as the  help for `rmarkdown::pdf_document`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="RMarkdown demo pdf_report template", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_rmd_pdf_report.png")
```


### R Markdown: Output format for a simple cheat sheet (PDF) - `pdf_cheatsheet`

Template for creating a simple cheat sheet. The PDF output format will be A4 sized and horizontal. You can define whether the cheat sheet should have 2,3,4 or more columns. Also the text and box 
colors and font size can be adjusted. The [LaTeX template by Sarah Lang](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/colourful-cheatsheet-template/qdsshbjktndd) served here as inspiration for the layout and code.

The templates includes predefined LaTeX commands for textboxes. If you want to use them to make your cheat sheet visually more appealing, you have to continue coding in LaTeX unfortunately. I didn't manage yet to get around LaTeX overall. However, the template .Rmd file provides several examples regarding the layout and LaTeX  syntax, which is hopefully sufficient enough for the inexperienced coder.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="RMarkdown demo pdf_cheatsheet template", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_rmd_pdf_cheatsheet.png")
```



### R Markdown: Jupyter Notebook output format - `rmd_to_jupyter`

While I'm a strong advocate of R Studio and R Studio server as IDE for R, there are times where [Juypter Notebook][https://jupyter.org/] is clearly the better option. Not only that Jupyter Notebooks allows running R directly in the browser without the installation of additional programs when using a remote Notebook server - this is in fact what R Studio Server is also for - but students can use it from any mobile device, including smartphones. This is particularly useful during lectures, when aiming to engage students more.

So I was looking for simple approaches to convert my R Markdown files into Jupyter Notebooks. Although I found some packages such as [markdowntemplates](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/markdowntemplates) or [notedown](https://github.com/aaren/notedown) (which the former depends on) I ran into few issues:

- you have to have Python and notedown installed and correctly setup before you can start
- when opening the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook locally or using a remote server, either no or the Phyton kernel was automatically started as all code chunks were read as Python code
- when choosing the R kernel for the notebook, the `%%R` flag appeared in each code chunk and had to be removed manually

So eventually I found a simpler approach in the [rmd2jupyter](https://github.com/mkearney/rmd2jupyter) package developed my Michael Kearney and converted his function into an R Markdown template here. The underlying function is a custom knit function, which converts the R Markdown code directly into a prettified JSON string using
`jsonlite::toJSON` and `jsonlite::prettify` and saves it then in an `.ipynb` file

The only thing you need in the YAML header is therefore:

```
---
knit: UHHformats::rmd_to_jupyter
---
```

Since everything from the YAML header will be cut out when converting the code, any title, author name or other field will be neglected.

When selecting the *Jupyter Notebook* template in R Studio a directory including the `.Rmd` file and `images/` subfolder will be created. Open the R Markdown file and change it however you want. Once you press the *knit* button you should see a line telling you were the `.ipynb` file was saved. And you're done!

When opening your file in Jupyter Notebook, please note that

- if you use a local installation of Jupyter Notebook, the program will automatically have access to all the subdirectories that your file links to
(e.g. the `images/` folder or any `data/` folder)
- if you use Jupyter Notebook server you need to upload the `.ipynb` file as well as all subdirectories together as a zip file. To unzip, simply open a new R notebook and write into the first cell: `unzip("zip_file_name.zip")`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="RMarkdown demo rmd_to_jupyter template", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_rmd_to_jupyter.png")
```

## Quarto template gallery

### Quarto: Simple HTML output format - `html`

This template converts the Quarto file into a simple HTML file with a fixed navigation bar on the left side including the UHH logo. To create a subdirecory including the Quarto template file type into the console

```{r, eval=FALSE}
UHHformats::create_quarto_doc(dirname = "choose_a_name", template = "html")
```

Many of the Quarto options for HTML output are listed in the YAML header. If you want to know more about these settings I recommend the [HTML format reference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) for a complete list of available options.

A nice Quarto feature is its extensive YAML intelligence (completion and diagnostics) in the RStudio IDE and in VS Code for project files, YAML front matter, and executable cell options. Just start with some letters and press the tab key on the keyboard. You will see a small dialog box with a list of available options.

The template contains already demo text, which will help you with e.g., writing equations, layouting images and tables, cross-referencing and adding citations in Quarto. If you need more help, go to Quarto's HTML documentation: [https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="Quarto demo template for HTML output", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_quarto_html.png")
```


### Quarto: Simple Microsoft Word output format - `word`

Similar to the R Markdown `word_doc` template, this Quarto template uses a 'uhh-template.docx' Word file, which is based on the [standard template file](https://www.kus.uni-hamburg.de/themen/oeffentlichkeitsarbeit/corporate-design/vorlagen.html) of the University of Hamburg (UHH) except for the font type, which is by default 'Helvetica'. You can choose the font in the template by typing into the console

```{r, eval=FALSE}
UHHformats::create_qmd_doc(dirname = "choose-a-name", 
  template = "word", font = "TheSansUHH")
```

More information is provided in the .qmd file. If you need additional help, go to Quarto's MS Word documentation: [https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) If you feel like using your own template or the standard Word template (i.e. the Normal.dot file), simply provide the path to your file under `reference-doc:` or comment/delete this line, respectively. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="Quarto demo template for MS Word output", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_quarto_word.png")
```


### Quarto: Output format for a simple PDF document in English (default) or German - `pdf_simple`

This template converts the Quarto file into a simple PDF/LaTeX - based document with a similar design than the R Markdown template `pdf_simple`. You can choose here between two font types: 'Helvetica' (default) and the University's own font 'TheSansUHH'. To create a subdirecory including the Quarto template file, type into the console

```{r, eval=FALSE}
UHHformats::create_quarto_doc(dirname = "choose-a-name", 
  template = "pdf_simple", font = "Helvetica")
```

More information is provided in the .qmd file. If you need additional help, go to Quarto's PDF documentation: [https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="Quarto demo template for a simple PDF document", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_quarto_pdf_simple.png")
```


### Quarto: Output format for a PDF report in English (default) or German - `pdf_report`

If you want to have more a report style document choose as template 'pdf_report':

```{r, eval=FALSE}
UHHformats::create_quarto_doc(dirname = "choose-a-name", 
  template = "pdf_report", font = "Helvetica")
```

The style of this template is similar to the R Markdown template `pdf_report` except for the cover page and the title page. The cover page can be adjusted using a different cover image and background and text color. Also the University logos on the title page can be replaced with your own logos.

More information is provided in the .qmd file. If you need additional help, go to Quarto's PDF documentation: [https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html).


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="Quarto demo template for a PDF report", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img_quarto_pdf_report.png")
```
