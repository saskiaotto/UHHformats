Description: R Markdown and Quarto templates for HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents, which are used 
    within the Biology Department of the University of Hamburg (UHH) and its 'Data Science in Biology'
    program. These include templates for student assignments, project reports,
    and conversions to Jupyter Notebooks. The package aims to encourage
    reproducible research using simple Markdown syntax while embedding all of the R code to 
    produce plots and analyses as well. Many templates are inspired by or based on other 
    packages such as 'rmdformats', 'ireports' or 'rmd2jupyter'.
